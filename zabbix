; http://php.net/date.timezone
date.timezone = 'Asia/Kolkata'

Step 3 – Install Zabbix Server
After adding Zabbix apt repository in your system use following command to install Zabbix server. Here zabbix-server-mysql package includes Zabbix server with MySQL support. The zabbix-frontend-php package provides and web interface is written in PHP for the Zabbix server management

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install zabbix-server-mysql zabbix-frontend-php
Step 4 – Create Database Schema
Now create a database schema for your Zabbix server. Login to your MySQL server using administrative privileges and use the following queries to create MySQL database and user for the Zabbix server.

mysql -u root -p

mysql> CREATE DATABASE zabbixdb;
mysql> GRANT ALL on zabbixdb.* to zabbix@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
Also load the Zabbix database schema to the database created above.

cd /usr/share/doc/zabbix-server-mysql
zcat create.sql.gz | mysql -u root -p zabbixdb
Step 5 – Edit Zabbix Configuration File
Edit Zabbix server configuration file /etc/zabbix/zabbix_server.conf in your favorite text editor and update the following database configurations. This will be used by Zabbix server to connect to the database.

  DBHost=localhost
  DBName=zabbixdb
  DBUser=zabbix
  DBPassword=password
Step 6 – Restart Apache and Zabbix
Zabbix creates its own apache configuration file /etc/zabbix/apache.conf and make a link to Apache configuration directory. Let’s use the following command to restart Apache service.

sudo service apache2 restart
Zabbix server configuration file are located at /etc/zabbix/zabbix_server.conf. Restart Zabbix server.

sudo service zabbix-server restart
